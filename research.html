        <h2>Cancer drug-tolerant persister cells: from biological questions to clinical opportunities</h2>

        <p>Roadmap article on cancer drug-tolerant persister cells, covering their key biological features such as phenotypic plasticity and heterogeneity, adaptation to treatment, 
            and potential to evade immune surveillance. We also cover potential therapeutic opportunities and key technologies to profile cancer drug-tolerant persister cells.

        <h2>A statistical framework for assessing pharmacological response and biomarkers using uncertainty estimates</h2>

        <p>Precision medicine is empowered by identifying robust drug response biomarkers. 
            However, experimental noise in drug high-throughput screens can lead to biased estimates of biomarker-drug response associations.</p>

        <p> Here, we introduce a novel, flexible dose-response fitting algorithm based on Gaussian processes (GPs) to produce confidence intervals 
            for drug response. In addition to this new dose-response metric, we provide a Bayesian framework which incorporates the uncertainty estimates 
            for the identification of biomarkers. This suggests the importance of quantifying uncertainty for in vitro drug experiments and advances the development 
            of precision medicine by improving reproducibility of biomarker association studies.</p>

        <h2>Defining subpopulations of differential drug response to reveal novel target populations</h2>

        <p>Comparisons of drugs have predominantly focused on identifying how individuals
            respond similarly, and there is a lack of data-driven insight into subpopulations of
            individuals with differential drug response.</p>

        <p>We applied a novel machine learning algorithm, SEgmentation And Biomarker Enrichment of
            Differential treatment response (SEABED), to compare drug response
            between cancer drug pairs. This data-driven approach paves a new way for patient
            stratification to identify novel cancer subpopulations, their genetic biomarkers, and
            effective drug combinations.</p>

        <h2>Looking beyond the hype: Applied AI and machine learning in translational medicine</h2>

        <p>Review article on common applied AI and machine learning approaches used in translational
            medicine, particularly in the areas of drug discovery, imaging, and genomic medicine. We also discuss
            limitations of these technologies in our review article as they do not come without their limitations and
            shortcomings.
